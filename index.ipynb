    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform classification using a text dataset, using sensible preprocessing, tokenization, and feature engineering scheme \n",
    "- Use scikit-learn text vectorizers to fit and transform text data into a format to be used in a ML model \n",

    "For this lab, we'll be working with the classic **_Newsgroups Dataset_**, which is available as a training data set in `sklearn.datasets`. This dataset contains many different articles that fall into 1 of 20 possible classes. Our goal will be to build a classifier that can accurately predict the class of an article based on the features we create from the article itself!\n",

    "* Do we use the entire vocabulary, or just limit the model to a subset of the most frequently used words? If so, how many?\n",
    "* Do we engineer other features, such as bigrams, or POS tags, or Mutual Information Scores?\n",

    "At first glance, none of these words seem very informative -- for most of the words represented here, it would be tough to guess if a given word is used equally among all five classes, or is disproportionately represented among a single class. This makes sense, because this frequency distribution represents all the classes combined. This tells us that these words are probably the least important, as they are most likely words that are used across multiple classes, thereby providing our model with little actual signal as to what class they belong to. This tells us that we probably want to focus on words that appear heavily in articles from a given class, but rarely appear in articles from other classes.
